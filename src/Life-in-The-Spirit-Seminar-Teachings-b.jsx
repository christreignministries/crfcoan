            1. Do not go into the rooms of any Reigner when you pay them a
            visit, apart from the sitting room, exceeding that would mean
            something else entirely.

            2. When you enter into any house, study the house. . Be calculative

            Train your children on how to receive things from anybody, for every
            tender has a sweet tone to sweet talk you into doing what you don't
            want to do. The best love you can show your children is not when you
            buy them expensive clothes, but when you put your eyes on them,
            don't take your eyes off your children for even an hour because the
            spoilers will spoil them for you. Every mother should always have
            eyes for their female children.

            6. Don't be a boss under your Boss â€” No matter how close you are
            with a friend, be careful for some certain things you do.

          <div className="paragraph">
            When you see a man you're staying with getting angry unnecessarily,
            it means the man is no longer comfortable with your presence in the
            house. What you suffer too much for, is what you'll want to die for.
            There are things you should not do no matter what! Anyone that
            comes/sits in your shop, is not only there to buy something but also
            to hear something about you. Do not let your husband come to the
            house to hear that your friend beat his children; when you want to
            discipline someone else's child use wisdom, don't be a boss. When
            you're living in a house where your age mate is a child in that
            house, it takes the grace of God to wear clothes given to you by the
            parents. Always take permission from the child of the house to avoid
            angering the child of the house. Apply wisdom.
