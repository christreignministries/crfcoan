  `During one of the anointing service, the man of GOD said we 
should connect to GOD and I told God that I want to be the first person that The man of GOD will attend to 
and behold I was the first person, He told me that GOD said he should attend to me. Prior to the service, my 
body was very heavy and I was asking myself if I would be able to attend the service. He prayed on my 
anointing oil and gave it back to me which I drank from. The moment I drank from it, I started vomiting blood. 
The more I vomit the more the heaviness in my body started leaving me. During my menstural flow, I 
always throw-up alongside with stomach pain. But after the encounter and till eternity, there is no pain, weakness, heaviness. 
Secondly, few months ago I was having itching, I went to the hospital to do several tests but after the 
encounter with the man of GOD, no more itching, praise the LORD.

  `I want to appreciate God for His goodness upon my life. The man of GOD 
  taught how to use the name of Jesus on a wednesday service. That night I had a dream that I was sweeping 
  my house so I mistakenly packed my hair brush in the waste bin and I threw it in the bush so I went out 
  in search of it. An old woman walked towards me and asked me what 
  I was looking for. I told her and she told me that I won’t find it there, rather I should go inside the 
  uncompleted building that's were I will find it. I went there and saw peoples' properties and many of my properties 
  that I’ve been looking for over many years. So I started packing all my properties, it was so much that I had to use 
  a car to pack them. I just want to appreciate GOD for recovering my lost properties, thank you JESUS.`,
