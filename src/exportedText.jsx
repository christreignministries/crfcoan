  `Pst Mrs Annabel`,
  `During one of the anointing service, the man of GOD said we 
should connect to GOD and I told God that I want to be the first person that The man of GOD will attend to 
and behold I was the first person, He told me that GOD said he should attend to me. Prior to the service, my 
body was very heavy and I was asking myself if I would be able to attend the service. He prayed on my 
anointing oil and gave it back to me which I drank from. The moment I drank from it, I started vomiting blood. 
The more I vomit the more the heaviness in my body started leaving me. During my menstural flow, I 
always throw-up alongside with stomach pain. But after the encounter and till eternity, there is no pain, weakness, heaviness. 
Secondly, few months ago I was having itching, I went to the hospital to do several tests but after the 
encounter with the man of GOD, no more itching, praise the LORD.

  `I want to appreciate God for His goodness upon my life. The man of GOD 
  taught how to use the name of Jesus on a wednesday service. That night I had a dream that I was sweeping
  my house so I mistakenly packed my hair brush in the waste bin and I threw it in the bush so I went out 
  in search of it. An old woman walked towards me and asked me what 
  I was looking for. I told her and she told me that I won’t find it there, rather I should go inside the 
  uncompleted building that's were I will find it. I went there and saw peoples' properties and many of my properties 
  that I’ve been looking for over many years. So I started packing all my properties, it was so much that I had to use 
  a car to pack them. I just want to appreciate GOD for recovering my lost properties, thank you JESUS.`,

  `04-11-2022. I want to appreciate GOD for HIS protection over my family. Last week thursday, my sister escaped accident four times
  in one day! Then this week thursday, my brother was attacked by armed robbers. Though they took everything that was with 
  him but they didn't harm him, he was safe and sound; Glory! Secondly, my mother has been sick, she was having problems and 
  they've booked her for operation so I came to church and registered for the PRAYER LINE. The man of GOD prayed for me and 
  said the operation will be cancelled and now my mum is okay, the leg pain has gone till eternity and the operation cancelled! 
  I just want to appreciate GOD for HIS goodness and say thank you JESUS.`,

  `25-09-2022. I want to appreciate GOD for HIS healing power upon my life. I was feeling heaviness in my stomach around the pelvic region 
  so I went for scan and the doctors said it was a big worm and I needed to operate it, that it wasn't normal but I just forgot 
  about it because I wasn't having money for it so I came to church on wednesday and I registered for PRAYER LINE. The man of GOD
  prayed for me and after the prayer I wasn't feeling the heaviness anymore up till now I can't feel anything, Glory!  Secondly; 
  ever since I got married I've not had any happiness in my marriage. Immediately I got married to my husband, everything ceased 
  for him, our finances was blocked. So the first day I came to church, the man of GOD located me with prophecy and told me exactly 
  what I was passing through then he prayed for me and asked me to go that from now heneforth things will be okay. So when I went 
  home and prayed to GOD to give me a sign if what the man of GOD said is true and these few weeks financial doors have been opening 
  for my husband, things are now getting better. I just want to appreciate GOD for HIS goodness over my life and I'm saying a big thank 
  you to the GOD of this commission, thank you JESUS!`,

  `24-08-2022. I want to appreciate GOD for HIS grace that has been speaking for me; I bought something two years ago but did not go to collect it, 
  they said the price of things has increased so I should add money to take the goods and I wasn't having any money. So I prayed to GOD 
  and called on the GOD of this commission and GOD answered me, later on the man told his wife to give me the goods, Without adding any 
  extra money! GLORY.  Secondly, I've been having weakness all over my body. I was seriously sick but now GOD has healed me and now I'm 
   strong. Lastly, Papa gave a prophecy that somebody is going to quarrel with a woman when she leaves the church but the woman should 
   not respond to the person because it will stop her testimony. So I knew I was the woman the man of GOD was talking to, after that 
   wednesday, the next day somebody came to quarrel with me in my shop but I remembered the prophecy and did not respond to the woman 
   at the end, my silence made favour to come my way, I received favour from men. I just want to say, thank you JESUS!`,
